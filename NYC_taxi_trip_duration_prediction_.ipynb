        "The New York City Taxi Trip Duration prediction project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the duration of a taxi ride given certain features such as pickup and dropoff coordinates, pickup datetime, and the number of passengers. The dataset used for this project contains information about 1.4 million taxi rides in New York City.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset is preprocessed by converting the pickup and dropoff timestamps to datetime objects and extracting additional features such as the day of the week, hour of the day, and whether the trip was taken during rush hour or not. The pickup and dropoff coordinates are also used to calculate the distance between the pickup and dropoff locations using the Geopy in Python library.\n",
        "Next, the project starts with data exploration and visualization to gain insights into the data. The exploratory data analysis includes scatterplots, histograms, pointplot and heatmaps to understand the distribution and correlation of the features in the dataset. The analysis shows that the duration of the taxi rides is positively skewed. Based on data exploitation and visualization the insights gained. The data was cleaned to remove outliers and inconsistencies. Trips lasting more than 24 hours or as little as 1 to 30 seconds were removed as they were likely outstation travel or trips with zero distance. Most trips had a single passenger, so zero passenger counts were replaced with one and trips with more than six passengers were removed to align with NYC regulations. Trips exceeding 100 km and speeds over 104 km/hour were considered outliers and removed. The trend of taxi pickups increased from 6AM to late evening around 8 PM, with the busiest hours being 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm, likely due to people returning home from work. There was a trend of increasing taxi pickups from Monday to Friday, with a decline from Saturday to Monday. Trips with zero distance but more than one minute of travel time were removed, likely due to cancelled bookings. Trips taking more than an hour to cover one or two kilometers were also removed, as this was highly unlikely in a developed city like NYC. These cleaning operations ensured that the data was more consistent and reliable for further analysis. VIF values are less than or equal to 5. so there is no high correlation among features.\n",

        "The next step involved feature engineering, where the store_and_fwd_flag feature was encoded using label encoding with Y:1 and N:0. For month and weekday features containing more than two categories, one-hot encoding was used. An 80/20 split ratio was used for model learning and evaluation. Recursive feature selection was employed for feature selection, and backward elimination was done based on the coefficient value of each feature by running different combinations. The selected features included pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude, distance, speed, month_June, month_May, weekday_Monday, and weekday_Sunday. Standard scalar was used for data scaling to normalize the features as they had different value ranges. Power transform was used to normally distribute the non-normally distributed input features, and linear regression model was trained and evaluated with an R2 score of 0.75 on the transformed data. This feature engineering process enabled the data to be prepared and modeled for further analysis.\n",

        "Linear regression was used to train and test the data for this regression problem. The model was evaluated using RMSE, R2 score, and adjusted R2 score, resulting in an R2 score of 0.80 and an RMSE of 296 seconds on the testing dataset.\n",

        "RandomizedSearchCV was used for hyperparameter tuning due to the large dataset of approximately 1.4 million records, and there was no improvement in accuracy after the tuning process. The ridge and lasso models yielded the same result as the R2 score remained at 0.80.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the large dataset of approximately 1.4 million records, the decision tree regressor was utilized as it is both fast and efficient. The hyperparameters were set to default, except for a maximum depth of 12 to avoid overfitting. The model was evaluated using RMSE and R2 score, yielding a high R2 score of 0.998 and a low RMSE of 27 seconds on the testing dataset and cross validation score of 0.998.\n",
